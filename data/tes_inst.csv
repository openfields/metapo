Occupied sites are often near wetlands and frequently are in association with gopher tortoise burrows. Pineland habitat is maintained by periodic fires. Viable populations of this species require relatively large tracts of suitable habitat. Refuges include tortoise burrows, stump holes, land crab burrows, armadillo burrows, or similar sites. Eggs may be laid in gopher (Geomys) burrows. May move seasonally between upland wintering sites and wetter lowland feeding areas.

Specific habitat associations vary geographically, as do substrate preferences. In the Mohave Desert, the tortoise occurs in creosote scrub, creosote bursage (Ambrosia dumosa), shadscale (Atriplex) scrub, Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) park, and, more rarely (in the northern periphery of their range), in mixed blackbush scrub between 3,500-5,000 feet elevation. In the warmer and lower Colorado Desert, tortoises generally are confined to creosote scrub and wash woodland habitats. Often native desert grasses, especially galleta (Hilaria/Plueraphis) and indian rice grass are associated with high tortoise densities, and the former species provides significant forage for adults.  Most often tortoise habitats are associated with well drained sandy loam soils in plains, alluvial fans, and bajadas, though tortoises occasionally occur in dunes, edges of basaltic flow and other rock outcrops, and in well drained and vegetated alkali flats.",na,Y,Resident,10,10,Resident,Y (2011),Y,28,"Number of populations and their viability is based on Murphy et al. 2007, who conducted a genetic analysis of the 6 Recovery Units from the RP and discovered ten distinct groups.

Natureserve:  ""The number of distinct occurrences (subpopulations) and locations has not been determined using standardized criteria. The number of occurrences likely would have to be based on arbitrary separation criteria, so the number would have relatively little conservation significance (e.g., occurrences likely would be relatively few but quite large). Instead, population size and area of occupancy are more meaningful measures of conservation status. Population Size: 100,000 - 1,000,000 individuals.
